Uber-like Project API Documentation
Overview
This Uber-like project allows users to sign up as riders or drivers. Riders can request rides, and drivers can accept, start, and complete rides. The system also supports OTP verification, surge pricing during late hours, and payments through wallets or cash. The application uses OSMR geolocation to track pickup and drop-off locations.

Features:
Riders can request rides, cancel them, rate drivers, and track their ride status.
Drivers can accept, start, and complete rides, rate riders, and manage their profile.
Admins can onboard new drivers and manage user roles.
